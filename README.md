Flexbox is a layout model in CSS that provides an efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute content within a container. The basic idea of the flexbox layout is to give the container the ability to alter the size, position, and order of its child elements to fill the available space in the best possible way. Flexbox is especially useful for creating responsive and dynamic web layouts, as it allows you to create complex, multi-dimensional layouts with relatively simple code.

Flexbox works by defining a "flex container" element and specifying the "flex items" inside it. The flex container uses a set of properties to control the layout and alignment of its child elements, while the flex items use a set of properties to control their own size, position, and order within the container.

Properties used in flexbox include:

    display: specifies the type of box used for the flex container
    flex-direction: specifies the direction in which the flex items are laid out within the container (horizontal or vertical)
    justify-content: specifies how the flex items are distributed along the main axis of the container (start, end, center, space-between, space-around, or space-evenly)
    align-items: specifies how the flex items are aligned along the cross axis of the container (top, bottom, center, baseline, or stretch)
    flex-wrap: specifies whether the flex items should wrap to a new line when the container is too small to fit them all on one line
    flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis: specify how the flex items should grow, shrink, and be sized within the container
        display: flex: This property sets the container to use flexbox layout.
    flex-direction: row-reverse: This property sets the direction of the main axis to be in reverse order horizontally, which means the elements are displayed from right to left.
    justify-content: space-between: This property aligns the elements with equal space between them along the main axis.
    align-items: flex-start: This property aligns the items to start from the cross-axis which is vertical in this case.
    flex-wrap: wrap: This property wraps the items into the next line when there is no more space on the current line.
